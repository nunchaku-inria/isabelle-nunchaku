Isabelle frontend:

  * partially unapplied builtins (eta-expand)
  * leverage 'if then else', 'let', 'match with'
  * type classes
  * quotient types
  * numeric types
  * other definitional mechanisms?
  * BNF-style nesting (through functions, mixed FPs, etc.)?
  * parse models

Middleware:

  * declare var not constant for cardinality witness
  * leverage empty sorts

  * syntax for models
  * specialization
  * heuristic inlining of definitions
  * (co)inductive predicates
  * quotient types
  * numeric types
  * BNF-style nesting (through functions, mixed FPs, etc.)?
  * polarity for other predicates
  * description operators
  * almost true / almost false predicate inference?
    (so that "card" and "finite" work for infinite domains)
  * finitize? (replace interpreted (typically infinite) type whose constructors are not used by
      uninterpreted type, if monotonic)

CVC4

  * syntax for empty sorts
