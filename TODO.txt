Isabelle frontend:

  * well-foundedness check
  * port other Nitpick tests

  * parse models

  * numeric types
  * other definitional mechanisms?
  * BNF-style nesting (through functions, mixed FPs, etc.)?

Middleware:

  * leverage empty sorts

  * syntax for models
  * specialization
  * heuristic inlining of definitions
  * (co)inductive predicates
  * quotient types
    * and "inline" trivial quotient types?
  * numeric types
  * BNF-style nesting (through functions, mixed FPs, etc.)?
  * polarity for other predicates
  * description operators
  * almost true / almost false predicate inference?
    (so that "card" and "finite" work for infinite domains)
  * finitize? (replace interpreted (typically infinite) type whose constructors are not used by
      uninterpreted type, if monotonic)

CVC4

  * syntax for empty sorts
