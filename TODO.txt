Isabelle frontend:

  * type classes
  * parse models

Middleware:

  * specialization
  * (co)inductive predicates
  * quotient types
  * polarity for other predicates
  * almost true / almost false predicate inference?
    (so that "card" and "finite" work for infinite domains)
  * finitize? (replace interpreted (typically infinite) type whose constructors are not used by
      uninterpreted type, if monotonic)
